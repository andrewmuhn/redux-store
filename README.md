# Redux-Store

## Description

- This basic book search app allows a user to log in a serach bup their favorite books or books they want to read and save them to one list for easy reference. After they are done they can look throught their saved books and delete them.
- I create this basic book-search-engine to practice converting a RESTful API to a GraphQL Api.
- This app utilizes googlebooks search api to query books.
- The app then uses a MongoDB Databse to hold user information and a list of books each user saved.
